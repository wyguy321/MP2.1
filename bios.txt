Faculty Profile Marc Bissonnette Section of Gastroenterology Associate Professor of Medicine mbissonn@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Academic Interests Dr. Bissonnettes research interests include investigations to understand factors that cause cells lining the colon to become cancerous. His laboratory is especially interested in how diet alters the susceptibility to develop colon cancer. He is studying Western diets that promote colon cancer growth and fish oil diets that inhibit tumor development. Dietary constituents have been shown to regulate growth factor signals. These growth factor signals are essential for healing colitis, but when chronically over-active, growth factor signals can promote tumor development. Western diets increase growth factor signals, whereas fish oil diets suppress them. We believe these diet-induced differences in growth factor signals play central roles in the tumor-promoting versus tumor-inhibiting activities of diet. Recent studies have implicated colonic bile acids and bacteria in controlling these growth factors. Future research efforts will focus on understanding how bile acids and bacteria collaborate to enhance Western diet-related growth factor signals that promote colon cancer. Dr. Bissonnette is also studying the role of inflammation (e.g. ulcerative colitis) in colon cancer development. Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon, is an important risk factor for colon cancer. We are currently investigating two microRNAs important for cell differentiation that appear to be strongly down-regulated in ulcerative colitis. Since these miRNAs have been shown to be colonic tumor suppressors, his lab speculates that their down-regulations contribute to ulcerative colitis-associated colon cancer. In recent studies, he showed that dietary vitamin D increases these anti-tumor miRNAs in human colon. Thus vitamin D supplementation could offer a promising new dietary approach to prevent colon cancer in individuals with ulcerative colitis.

Faculty Profile Eugene Chang Section of Gastroenterology Professor of Medicine echang@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine; Associate Director for Academic Programs & Training in Gastroenterology Academic Interests Dr. Chang's laboratory studies intestinal microbes and viruses (the microbiome), particularly as they relate to health, digestive diseases (IBD) and other immune- and metabolic-related disorders. This relationship is fundamental to our health and, when perturbed, the consequences can be catastrophic. The emergence of Western disorders like diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer and autoimmune disorders over the past century may be related to large shifts in the composite human microbiome caused by changes in the environment and life styles. In genetically susceptible individuals, these factors can potentially trigger events that disturb immune and metabolic homeostasis, initiating the development of disease. His efforts are therefore directed towards gaining a better understanding of what factors are involved in the selection and assembly of intestinal microbes, and how they can be used to reshape the enteric microbiome to prevent and treat disease. His lab employs cutting edge approaches that include cultivation-dependent and independent technologies for microbial analysis, genetically modified and gnotobiotic mouse models, metabolic and functional measurements, and advanced bioinformatic tools to investigate both host and microbiome. The role of heat shock protein in maintaining intestinal and immune homeostasis Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a highly conserved family of multifunctional molecules. Dr. Chang also studies the role of heat shock protein in maintaining intestinal and immune homeostasis. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a highly conserved family of multifunctional molecules. They play a role in mucosal cytoprotection, host-microbe interactions, innate immunity, cancer initiation and development, and in autophagy. Although many types are constitutively expressed, some, such as HSP70 and HSP25, are rapidly induced and preferentially synthesized under conditions of cellular stress and injury. Their physiological expression in the gut is maintained by cues and signals provided by the enteric microbiota. In epithelial cells, their induction protects against toxic, oxidant, and thermal injury. His laboratory, therefore, is investigating cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate their cytoprotective effects in the context of mucosal inflammation. These studies involve correlations of molecular and biochemical techniques with physiological findings and imaging analysis. These investigations involve extensive multi-disciplinary collaborations with other investigators in the Biological Science Division and at Argonne National Laboratory.

Faculty Profile Ronald Cohen Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Associate Professor of Medicine roncohen@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Chief, Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Academic Interests Dr. Cohen's lab focuses on three areas: (1) the role of nuclear receptor corepressors in hormone action; (2) the role of the extracellular matrix in adipocyte biology; and (3) various topics in clinical thyroidology. In terms of the first area, we are currently focusing on the corepressor SMRT and its function in the adipocyte. Although the adipocyte was previously considered solely an energy storage depot, we now understand that its an active endocrine cell. Adipocyte differentiation is also uniquely dependent on the nuclear receptor PPARgamma. His initial studies showed that SMRT regulates PPARgamma transcriptional activity and, in fact, dictates the degree of activation induced by thiazolidinediones, which are exogenous PPARgamma ligands used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. More recently, he has designed mice with decreased SMRT levels. These mice exhibit normal weight on a chow diet, but develop increased adiposity when fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, adipocytes derived from these mice exhibit enhanced insulin actions, even in the setting of increased adiposity. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that impairments in the ability to expand fat mass appropriately in the setting of positive energy balance may lead to metabolic derangements in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Dr. Cohen also studies the role of the extracellular matrix in adipose tissue, and have recently shown that deletion of the laminin alpha-4 chain leads to resistance to obesity; his current work aims to define how the extracellular matrix directly dictates adipocyte function.

Faculty Profile Eileen Dolan Section of Hematology / Oncology Professor of Medicine edolan@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Academic Interests Recent advances in genome research have suggested strong associations between genetic factors and complex human traits, such as an individuals disease susceptibility, response to drugs and gene expression levels. Most chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit serious toxicity; hence elucidating the genetic variants that alter response to chemotherapy and/or toxicity is an important but challenging project. Challenges include our inability to do family studies evaluating the effects of chemotherapy on individuals without cancer and the multigenic nature of drug response. Our research program focuses on determining the genetic variants responsible for inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in response to chemotherapy using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from individuals collected for the International HapMap Project. The long-term goal is to identify patients at risk for non response or toxicity associated with chemotherapy. We have developed several cell-based models that employ EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from Caucasians of European descent (CEU); Yorubans of African descent (YRI); Japanese in Tokyo, Japan; Han Chinese in Beijing, China; Chinese in metropolitan Denver, CO, USA; African ancestry in the Southwest USA; and Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, CA, USA to evaluate chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity and/or apoptosis. Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that chemotherapeutic induced cytotoxicity is a heritable trait. We systematically evaluated SNPs associated with chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity for various chemotherapeutic agents and found that these pharmacogenomic markers are disproportionately likely to be expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs, indicating that a SNP genotype is associated with the transcript abundance level of a gene). We developed a triangle approach to identify genetic variants associated with chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity that are also associated with gene expression and whose target genes baseline expression significantly correlate to drug cytotoxicity. We have numerous clinical trials aimed at testing these SNPs as pharmacogenomic markers for patient response and/or toxicity to chemotherapy.

Faculty Profile Alexandra Dumitrescu Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Associate Professor of Medicine adumitre@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Academic Interests Dr. Dumitrescus research is focused on the study of the pathophysiology of inherited defects affecting the thyroid function, in particular those involving transmembrane thyroid hormone transport and intracellular thyroid hormone metabolism. One of the defects she studies is that of the X-linked gene MCT8, a transmembrane transporter of thyroid hormone. Its deficiency results in severe psychomotor and development delay in males, also known as Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome. Among known inherited disorders of the thyroid axis in humans, this is the first involving thyroid hormone transport into cells. Dr. Dumitrescu has generated an Mct8 knockout mouse model. Extensive in vivo and in vitro work on this mouse model continues to uncover the underlying mechanisms for this complex defect.Another novel thyroid defect she studies is that caused by mutations in selenocysteine incorporation sequence binding protein 2 (SBP2) and represents the first defect in a component of the selenoprotein synthesis machinery. This deficiency has consequence on growth and thyroid function at young age, causes decreased fertility in males and is expected to result in increased cancer susceptibility in both genders with age. Severe SBP2 gene mutations present additional features, such as congenital myopathy, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss and complex immune deficits, thus reflecting multiple selenoprotein deficiencies. Dr. Dumitrescu's current studies address the need for an in vivo model to further understand the pathophysiology of this new genetic defect, by generating mouse models with Sbp2 deficiency. Initial investigations will uncover the underlying mechanisms for the characteristic thyroid phenotype, infertility, growth delay and myopathy. The study of the aging animals will allow close monitoring for manifestations later in life, and other presumed phenotypes, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and immune dysfunction.

Faculty Profile Lucy Godley Section of Hematology / Oncology Professor of Medicine lgodley@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Hospira Foundation Professor in Oncology Academic Interests Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, alter chromatin structure, thereby regulating gene transcription. Cancer cells are characterized by abnormal DNA methylation, and work in my laboratory focuses on elucidating mechanisms that control DNA methylation within cancer cells. Our laboratory has shown that cancer cells exhibit aberrant splicing of the DNMT3B gene, which encodes one of the three DNA methyltransferases. The aberrant splicing produces DNMT3B transcripts containing premature stop codons, which encode truncated proteins lacking the catalytic domain. We hypothesize that truncated DNMT3B proteins contribute to the abnormal DNA methylation observed in cancer cells, and we are currently testing this hypothesis in mouse and in several human tumor systems. Transgenic mice expressing DNMT3B7, the truncated DNMT3B protein most frequently observed in cancer cells, exhibit disrupted embryonic development, including defects in craniofacial development, heart formation, and in the development of the skeletal and hematopoietic systems. Many of these phenotypes are also seen in human who have mutations of the DNMT3B gene. We observe changes in DNA methylation within organs that express the transgene, thus supporting our hypothesis. The DNMT3B7 transgenic animals provide a model by which we can study the molecular mechanism for the DNA methylation alterations seen in cancer cells. We have crossed them to the Emu-myc transgenic mice, which are predisposed to the development of B cell lymphomas, and we observe striking alterations to the kinetics of tumor formation in double transgenic animals. We are also testing our hypothesis that truncated DNMT3B isoforms regulate DNA methylation within human cancers: neuroblastoma (in conjunction with Susan Cohn and her laboratory) and myeloid leukemias. We are currently correlating the complement of DNMT3B transcripts with the DNA methylation state of primary human tumors.

Faculty Profile Mary Hammes Section of Nephrology Associate Professor of Medicine mhammes@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Director, Woodlawn Dialysis facility Academic Interests Dr. Mary Hammes has cared for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis for over 20 years. She is particularly attuned and appreciates the struggles that this patient population endures. The most significant of these is the placement and maintenance of vascular access used in hemodialysis. Her current research interests which have been funded by the NIH for over 7 years have focused on the improvement of vascular access for this patient population. To this end, Dr. Hammes has developed an indepth understanding of the mechanisms responsible for venous stenosis and thrombosis in arteriovenous fistulae, and has developed new approaches for the management of cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) in patients with brachiocephalic fistula access. CAS is a common problem which is difficult to treat and contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of ESRD patients. Graft and fistulae thrombosis is also a major clinical problem for ESRD patients which currently have very limited treatments options. Dr. Hammes collaborates with Anindata Basu PhD., section of Genetic Medicine at University of Chicago and Argonne labs, and has created a novel milli-fluidic device that includes an exact replication of a cephalic arch in patients with brachiocephalic fistula and is scientifically used to determine if components of blood or varying hemodynamic conditions contribute to venous thrombosis of vascular access. By using a multidisciplinary expert team of bioengineers, specialists in nanotechnology, clinical nephrology, hematology and interventional techniques Dr. Hammes has developed a leading program in the investigation of complications of vascular access in hemodialysis patients.

Faculty Profile Hatim Hassan Section of Nephrology Associate Professor of Medicine hhassan@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Academic Interests Dr. Hassans research focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating intestinal oxalate transport, with a special emphasis on the gut epithelial transporter SLC26A6, by different neurohumoral factors and gut microbiome, and how this regulation might pertain to the risk of hyperoxalemia, hyperoxaluria, and calcium oxalate kidney stones. Seventy-80% of kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, and small increases in urinary oxalate enhance the risk of stone development. The mammalian intestine plays a crucial role in oxalate homeostasis. Intestinal oxalate secretion mediated by the key oxalate transporter SLC26A6 plays an essential role in limiting net intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate, thereby preventing hyperoxalemia, hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate kidney stones. Dr. Hassan had previously shown that cholinergic, purinergic, and adenosinergic signaling inhibits oxalate transport by human intestinal epithelial cells by reducing SLC26A6 surface membrane expression. Dr. Hassans current projects include: Potential roles of proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of obesity - and IBD-associated hyperoxaluria. In addition, Dr. Hassans lab is evaluating the role of factors secreted by the probiotic bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes (Of) in reducing urinary oxalate excretion in hyperoxaluric mice by stimulating colonic oxalate secretion. In this regard the Hassan lab has successfully identified small peptides derived from a family of signaling proteins as the Of-derived factors. These findings indicate that small peptides can be developed therapeutically and a startup company (Oxalo Therapeutic) has been recently formed to facilitate the achievement of the long-term goal of developing a peptide-based oral drug for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperoxalemia, hyperoxaluria, and calcium oxalate kidney stones.

Faculty Profile Hae Kyung Im Section of Genetic Medicine Assistant Professor of Medicine him1@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Academic Interests Dr. Im's research centers on developing statistical methods to sift through the vast amounts of genomic and other high dimensional data to understand the biological mechanisms that drive complex diseases with the ultimate goal of making discoveries that can be translated into improving the health of people. She focuses on methods that predict and dissect complex traits using data from multiple heterogeneous sources. For example, she has proposed a prediction method called OmicKriging that integrates data from heterogeneous sources to improve prediction performance. She has also used the prediction of intermediate phenotypes as an instrument to probe the mechanisms that link genetic variants with complex diseases and traits. This is implemented in two related methods called PrediXcan and MetaXcan. Her methods, software, and results are open to the public to promote open and reproducible science.

His research groups work is on the diagnosis, care and treatment patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI occurs commonly in hospitalized patients, especially in the setting of critical illness and the intensive care unit setting. In this context, AKI carries an alarmingly high morbidity and mortality rate. One of Dr. Koyners main projects involves utilizing predictive models, which harnesses data available and collected in the electronic medical record that allows for the identification and treatment of hospitalized patients at risk for the development of AKI in real time. Along with colleagues from the Department of Medicine and the Center for Health Care Delivery and Innovation Dr. Koyner has developed the Electronic Signal To Prevent AKI (ESTOP-AKI) a real-time AKI risk model. This model will assist in decreasing the incidence of AKI as well as improving outcomes in hospitalized patients who develop AKI. Other research projects that are ongoing in Dr. Koyners lab include using novel urinary biochemical biomarkers of kidney injury to identify and treat patients early with severe AKI. These investigations compare novel biomarker performance to the current gold standard, serum creatinine as a marker of AKI and determine how well these biomarkers prognosticate AKI severity and the risk for long-term adverse clinical events. Dr Koyner is also involved in projects that explore potential prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for AKI in the context of critical illness performed in collaboration with investigators from Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Anesthesia Critical Care. As director of UCMCs Inpatient Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Unit, he has performed studies investigating the optimal delivery of continuous RRT (CRRT) in the setting of the most severe forms of AKI.

Faculty Profile Willard Sharp Section of Emergency Medicine Associate Professor of Medicine wsharp@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Academic Interests Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a commonly encountered clinical phenomenon and is especially prevalent in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and cardiac arrest. Dr. Sharp was originally a cardiac cell biologist before his career as an Emergency Medicine Physician and his research combines his interest of both by investigating the mechanisms of I/R injury as well as the development of new clinical interventions in the acute setting. Cardiac I/R injury is well known to be associated with increased reactive oxygen species and the activation of apoptotic signaling cascades associated with cellular death. Although the exact mechanism of such injury are not entirely known, the generation of nitric oxide (NO) appears to play a prominent role since I/R injury can be attenuated in the presence of increased NO. One new development in the field of I/R injury, is the use of hypothermia to improve morbidity and mortality in the setting of cardiac arrest. Work by others in the Department have demonstrated the effects of hypothermia protection may be due in part to increased NO generation. Dr. Sharp's current research is aimed at understanding how hypothermia modulates apoptotic signaling cascades, NO generation, and cardiac cell death. Recently we have shown that the cell survival kinase Akt is down regulated during ischemia and early I/R but is up regulated by hypothermia in chick cardiomyocytes. Further elucidation of these cell signaling cascades is ongoing. The ultimate goal of this research is to translate our understanding of cardiac cell biology and I/R injury into new bedside therapies for our patients in the settings of acute coronary syndromes and cardiac arrest.

Faculty Profile Corey Tabit Section of Cardiology Assistant Professor of Medicine ctabit@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Referring Physician Access Line: 1-877-DOM-2730 Academic Interests Dr. Tabit is a translational physician-scientist with an interest in vascular development, homeostasis, and situational response. His research examines the effects of mechanical circulatory support on the blood vessels. Patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) often develop pathologic angiodysplasia in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, brain, and others. These atypical vessels frequently bleed, a devastating complication for LVAD patients. Dr. Tabit investigates the molecular mechanisms of this pathologic vessel formation as well as the interactions among the LVAD device, the blood, and the blood vessels. Dr. Tabits recent findings have revealed a critical role of Angiopoietin-2, a potent angiogenic growth factor, in the pathogenesis of LVAD-related angiodysplasia. Together with Tumor Necrosis Factor-a, Angiopoietin-2 induces dysplastic vessel growth and apoptosis of critical vascular support cells which lead to bleeding events. Dr. Tabit is now testing pharmaceutical agents to prevent LVAD-related angiodysplasia and improve outcomes for patients with LVADs.

Dr. Weinsteins group develops new modalities of biological measurement, drawing from tools in molecular biology, physics, and applied mathematics. The group builds on the premise that technological mastery of DNA synthesis, manipulation, and sequence-readout over the past few decades provides fundamentally new opportunities to deepen our understanding and command of the microscopic world. Dr.Weinstein completed his undergraduate studies in physics and biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania, and his PhD in biophysics at Stanford University in 2012 under the direction of Professors Stephen Quake and Daniel Fisher. There, he published the first global measurements of immune receptor sequence repertoires, using the zebrafish as a model organism. Weinstein later applied repertoire-sequencing to immune development and human vaccine response. He completed his postdoctoral work at the Broad Institute/MIT, under the joint-mentorship of Professors Feng Zhang and Aviv Regev, where he was supported by a Simons Fellowship from the Life Sciences Research Foundation. There, he developed DNA microscopy, enabling biological specimens to image themselves and thereby generating detailed spatio-genetic data sets, which bypass the need for specialized equipment.

Faculty Profile Amittha Wickrema Section of Hematology / Oncology Professor of Medicine awickrem@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Director, Clinical Cell Therapy Laboratory;Director, cGMP Cellular Manufacturing Core Facility Academic Interests Dr. Wickrema's work is focused on the study of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. His laboratory's work over the years has entailed studying the signaling pathways underlying lineage commitment and terminal differentiation of adult blood/bone marrow stem cells into erythroid cells. A human in vitro primary cell culture model developed by his group has been pivotal in efforts towards understanding the signal transduction pathways and molecular mechanisms that regulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation into mature red blood cells. These efforts have identified the key pathways as well as cytokines that regulate the overall red blood cell production. His group has active collaborations with multiple research groups both at University of Chicago and around the country. Current work include projects that are focused on understanding the precise functional and prognostic implications of specific mutations as seen in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of malignant blood disorders . These studies include designing novel strategies for therapeutic intervention using the knowledge gained by the DNA sequence information publicly available to the scientific community. A second line of investigation focuses on understanding the epigenetic signals that permit lineage commitment of blood/morrow stem cells and molecular mechanisms underlying terminal events in human erythroid differentiation program. This includes studying the biological pathways that permit the extrusion of the nucleus, which is exclusive to most mammalian red blood cells. A third line of investigation focuses on developing methods for using blood stem cells and partially differentiated blood cells for treatment of anemia and other blood disorders as cell replacement therapies. A key goal of this research is to devise strategies that will lead to creation of low cost high value cellular therapy products.

Faculty Profile Jayasri Nanduri Section of Emergency Medicine Research Professor jnanduri@bsd.uchicago.edu Academic Interests Dr. Nanduris laboratory examines the impact of hypoxia on ion channel trafficking, especially K+ channels, which are critical for regulating various cellular responses to low O2 such as cellular excitability, maintenance of membrane potential, and neurotransmitter secretion. Hypoxia is a pervasive physiological stimulus that occurs under many different pathophysiological circumstances and can be either continuous (CH) or intermittent (IH).Ongoing projects are aimed at defining the intracellular signaling pathways by which CH and chronic IH regulate O2 sensitive K+ channel protein trafficking in both animal and cell culture models and their impact on physiological responses.

Faculty Profile Ying-Jie Peng Section of Emergency Medicine Research Associate Professor ypeng1@bsd.uchicago.edu Academic Interests Humans experiencing chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) as a consequence of recurrent apneas are prone to develop augmented sympathetic nerve activity, hypertension and ventilatory abnormalities. Dr. Peng's research focuses on assessing the mechanisms associated with CIH-induced autonomic abnormalities. The lab is specifically testing the role of carotid bodies, the primary chemoreceptor for sensing arterial blood O2. Their studies demonstrate that CIH leads to enhanced hypoxic sensing of the carotid body involving reactive oxygen species-mediated signaling mechanisms. Consequently, they are currently testing the hypothesis that CIH-induced functional re-modeling of the carotid body results in reflexive activation of sympathetic nerve activity and elevated blood pressure.

Faculty Profile Sarah Tersey Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Research Associate Professor stersey@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Academic Interests Dr. Sarah Tersey is an islet biologist whose research focuses on the role of the -cell in the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The primary goal of her research focuses on understanding the molecular pathways that play a role in the development of diabetes. Specifically, pathways that include the enzymes 12-lipoxygnease and deoxyhypusine synthase. By using inhibitors against these pathways or creating genetic deletions of either of these genes, Dr. Tersey has shown that diabetes can be prevented. A second major focus of my research is the development of biomarkers that will best predict the likelihood of any one individuals risk to develop type 1 diabetes. Within this concept, she demonstrated that the dysfunction of the pancreatic islet precedes the onset of type 1 diabetes. This research has changed the standard dogma of the islet as a silent bystander to the immune system, to the new way of thinking that the pancreatic islet is a major player in its own demise during the pre-course of type 1 diabetes.

Currently, his laboratory has several ongoing research projects including unveiling the molecular mechanism behind specific translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis (the major regulation of insulin production); examining the role of FoxO and NFAT transcription factors in controlling IRS-2 gene expression in -cells that is key for their survival; investigating H2O2 as a bona fide nutrient generated secondary signal in -cells; unraveling the CNS neuronal network that controls pancreatic endocrine - and ?-cell function; examining the interface between the -cell and immune system in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes; and also, functionally evaluating insulin-producing cells derived from alternative sources, such as human embryonic stem cells, that might eventually be used as surrogate -cells as a cell-replacement therapy to treat type 1 diabetes.

Faculty Profile Eve Van Cauter Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Professor of Medicine Emeritus, Frederick H. Rawson Professor; Director, Sleep,Metabolism and Health Center Academic Interests Dr. Van Cauters major interests are the role of sleep in the regulation of hormonal release and metabolism and the characterization of the abnormal sleep patterns found in a variety of conditions, including aging. She uses analyses of temporal patterns of hormonal secretion to study the functional significance of sleep and circadian rhythmicity on endocrine function in normal and pathological conditions. In recent years, Dr. Van Cauter has also led a major research program evaluating the impact of decreased sleep duration and quality on the risk of obesity and diabetes and the possible endocrine and metabolic benefits of improved sleep quality in older adults.
